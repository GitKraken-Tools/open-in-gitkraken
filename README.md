# Open in GitKraken üêô - Chrome Extension

‚ö° Clone repositories in a jiffy using GitKraken's [deep link API](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/linking)

## Installation

The extension is not currently in the Chrome Web Store as it is still in alpha. To install it manually, open your chrome extensions tab at `chrome://extensions/` and enable developer mode.

Then, download and extract this project to a folder on your computer, and import the folder with the "Load Unpacked" button in the extensions page.

## Usage

Install the extension and open GitHub to a **public** repository (private repos are not currently supported, see [issue](https://github.com/kyjus25/chrome-open-in-gk/issues/3). The extension will generate a GitKraken deep link for the repository and inject a button in the "clone" dropdown to open or clone the repository directly with GitKraken!
